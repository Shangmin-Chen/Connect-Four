Problem Set 9: Problem 0
Put your response to the reading below.
1. Suppose that pivot searching were readily available to you. To what extent could you imagine using it? Do you feel it would make you more productive – or would this type of search remain largely unused in the way you interact with computation and electronic materials?
If pivot searching is an existing technology, I can see a select group using it a lot and assisting them to dramatically accelerate their work speed. There are people who forget things a lot, people with mental disorders (amnesia). People with ADHD can also use this to see if there was anything they were doing before that they forgot. However, personally I don’t see myself using this to that extent. I don’t see instances where I would need pivot searching. In addition, I feel like relying “memorization” on technology is making people lose their humanity little by little.
